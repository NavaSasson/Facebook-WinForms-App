# Facebook-WinForms-App
Development of a win form application in .NET and #C that makes use of the Facebook Graph API &amp; Using UML diagrams
The application must give the user a basic Facebook experience, and in addition provide the user with at least two features (use cases) related to Facebook that are not realized on Facebook's website.
In addition to the application, attached:

One Use Case Diagram that describes the functionality of your application.
Two Sequence Diagrams, one for each of your two new Use Cases.
In case the Use Case has more than one scenario, you must describe the most complex scenario.
Class Diagram Class Diagram that describes the classes involved in the implementation (a full description that includes Properties and Methods) and the relationships between them (a full and accurate description for each relationship as we learned in class). Classes from the Facebook API (for example the classes FacebookService, User, Page, Event) that you use should also be included in this diagram.
